[Capstone Project](https://github.com/sdnguyen98/miniPaint) (My senior capstone project


[Particle System](hhttps://github.com/sdnguyen98/Qr-Code-Generator)

This project involved creating a particle system that followed some form of real physics. I decided I wanted to make a fountain like object. I created the particles in a particle array that updated every 10 milliseconds. During the update period, the velocity, location, and color of the particles was updated making it look like the particles are moving seemlessly. I also did this project but instead of loading it into an array I utilized parallel processing to load in and update the particles on different thread on the GPU and then loaded it onto the CPU to display. The repo can be found [here](https://github.com/bullocgr/parallel-programming/tree/master/project7A).
